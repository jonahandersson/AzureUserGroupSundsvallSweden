# About 

[Azure User Group Sundsvall Sweden](https://www.meetup.com/azureusergroupsundsvallsverige) is an independent local and remote Meetup Azure users group started and founded by Jonah Andersson, who saw that her local community didn’t have an active community group for Azure developers. 

A user group that aims to be inclusive and diverse. It is open to all software developers, software engineers, cloud architects, tech and cloud enthusiast in Sweden or remote. 
The purpose of this user group is to unite everyone who wants to learn more about development in Microsoft Azure, cloud, AI, ML, and other modern technologies. 

We welcome to all interested developers or speakers who wants to volunteer, share and discuss their knowledge with others publicly.
